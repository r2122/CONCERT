        The HHT concert that happened in YMCA was my first ever concert. I didn't have many expectations for the concert, because I was constantly reminded of the ARR debacle, which quite a few of my friends experienced.

Boy was I wrong. I didn't really expect to see the view of the stage clearly since I'd booked tickets in Bronze, but that didn't change much. I enjoyed vibing with my homies and threcrowd were going crazy. I never thought I would dance with strangers! Damn! I never expected this much out of Chennai! HHT was also quite concerned with the audience. He even gave his bottle of electrolytes to a member of the audience who I think had fainted? It was quite a nice touch. Also he sung most of his songs live, which surprised me because I've heard artists are quite notorious for lip syncing. The best parts were: the whole crowd screaming 'adrangotha' and when it drizzled when he started singing 'Vaadi pulla vaadi'.
